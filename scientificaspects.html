        <h2>The Greenhouse Effect </h2>
        <img src="Earth's_greenhouse_effect_(US_EPA,_2012).png" width="50%" align="right" style="padding: 30px;"/>
        <p>The greenhouse effect is a process by which the Sun's solar radiation heats up the Earth. Some of the energy rebounding off of the Earth is absorbed by greenhouse gases,
          capturing the energy and heating up the atmosphere. As the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
          increases, more heat is trapped in Earth's system, leading to a cyclical cycle of global warming. These greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>),
          nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), water vapor, and others. CO<sub>2</sub> is released into the atmosphere when organic materials like fossil fuels are burned.
          N<sub>2</sub>0 is naturally released into the envrionment in small quantities, but human activies such as agriculture and burning biomass have caused an increase in N<sub>2</sub>O.
          CH<sub>4</sub> escapes into the atmosphere whenever fossil fuels are mined, during livestock farming, and in the decomposition of waste in landfills.</p>

        <h2>How Humans Have Contributed to Climate Change</h2>
        <p>Humans have caused the carbon dioxide levels to spiral out of control by burning fossil fuels, throwing away too much trash,
        and driving too much. If nothing is done soon, the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will soon cause world temperatures
        to rise to temperatures that will affect how much food can be grown and various environments around the world. Fortunately, there
        are solutions to this problem and they are easy to adjust to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><u>Drive Less</u>: Ride the bus or carpool and have your kids get their drivers' licenses later. Drive if you have no other choice.</li>
          <li><u>Plant More</u>: Plants absorb CO<sub>2</sub> and emit oxygen back into the atmosphere. Encourage your kids to volunteer to grow
            plants and they can get community service from them at the same time! It's a win-win!</li>
          <li><u>Eat Meat Less</u>: Producing red meat, and the agricultural industry in general, releases incredible amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> and consumes
            gallons upon gallons of water. Stick to the veggies: They're healthier, and better for the environment!</li>
          <li><u>Shop at Local Farmers' Markets</u>: Although farmers' markets may be a little more expensive, more organic options are available. The food they sell is locally
            grown and does not have to be transported as far. This means that less oil is burned and healthier food is the result!</li>
          <li><u>Waste Less Food</u>: Although food can be compostable, it takes a large amount of resources, including energy and water,
            to grow it and wasting that food would be detrimental to not only the environment, but the economy as well.</li>
          <li><u>Learn How to Recycle</u>: Keep up with the current recycling guidelines (they differ from cites) and learn what can be recycled and what can not. Improper recycling leads to contamination,
             which causes the entire bag of recyclable material to be thrown into the landfill.</li>
          <li><u>Stop Fast Fashion</u>: Research companies and learn if they are conscious of their water usage,
            use sustainable and environmentally friendly methods of fabric production and pay fair wages to their employees.</li>
        </ul>
